# Array Iteration Solution

`3`
`6`
`9`

This is a trick question. The `colors` array is extranneous information, and should be ignored. And the `color` argument is just a word -- it could have been called anything at all -- and refers to elements in the `numbers` array, not to any actual colors.

All we are doing is iterating through the `numbers` array and checking for numbers that are divisible by `3`. Only these numbers will be printed to the console; all others will be ignored. So all you get are:

`3`
`6`
`9`
